# Udacity-Nanodegree-Memory-Game
The second project for the Front-End Nanodegree course in the "Web Progamming with JavaScript" lesson

This game is a memory card game. The user has to click on a card to reveal what's behind it and then try to find this card identical.
If you click on 2 same cards the turn green and their symbol is shown. If you don't then the 2 different cards are buzzing and turn red for 1 sec and then they are again blank.

On top of the card deck the user can see the moves he made so far, the star rating for the move count and a timer.
